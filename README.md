# Stock Performance Analysis Project

## Overview
This project offers a multi-dimensional analysis of stock performance over three years. Our team, consisting of Mark, Necole, Feven, and Qasim, has conducted a comprehensive study that delves into various aspects of stock behavior. The goal is to provide insights that aid in informed investment decisions and portfolio diversification strategies.

## Project Scope
Our analysis covers a wide range of areas, including but not limited to:

1. **Basic Stock Trends:** We examine the closing prices of each stock over the three-year period to identify trends. Simple line charts are used to visualize upward, downward, or sideways trends.

2. **Volatility Analysis:** We calculate the standard deviation of daily returns for each stock to understand its volatility. A higher standard deviation indicates higher volatility, which can imply greater risk or potential reward.

3. **Comparative Return Analysis:** We compute the total returns for each stock over the three-year period. This can help in comparing which stocks provided the best return on investment.

4. **Dividend Analysis:** We analyze the Ex-Dividend data to calculate the yield for each stock. Comparing dividend yields can be particularly interesting for income-focused investors.

5. **Split Analysis:** We investigate the Split Ratio column to identify any stock splits. We also analyze how the stock price and volume reacted before and after the split.

6. **Volume Analysis:** We examine trading volumes to identify days with unusually high activity. High volumes can sometimes precede price jumps, either up or down.

7. **Price Range Analysis:** We calculate the daily price range (High - Low) for each stock to understand its daily price movement and volatility.

8. **Moving Averages:** We compute moving averages (such as 50-day or 200-day) for closing prices to help smooth out price action and identify the direction of the trend.

9. **Seasonal Patterns:** We analyze the data to identify any seasonal patterns. For example, do stocks tend to perform better in certain months of the year?

10. **Event Impact Analysis:** We analyze the impact of major financial events on stock prices. Identify dates of significant global or national economic events within the 2015-2017 range, such as interest rate changes, economic policy announcements, or major geopolitical events. Then, analyze how the stock prices reacted in the days or weeks following these events. This can help in understanding the sensitivity of different stocks to macroeconomic factors and can be valuable for making future investment decisions, especially for investors looking to manage risk during times of uncertainty.

11. **Adjusted Prices Analysis:** We compare the adjusted closing prices with the actual closing prices to understand the impact of dividends and stock splits on stock value.

12. **Correlation Analysis:** We compute the correlation between different stocks' movements. This can help in portfolio diversification by identifying stocks that move in opposite directions.

## Data Sources
We gathered the data from Nasdaq, a reputable source for stock market data. Our data is up-to-date and covers the past three years.
